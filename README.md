# QuadScript Language

This extension aims to integrate the Quadrilateral Cowboy scripting language (DoomScript) into Visual Studio Code.

## Features

Currently only syntax highlighting and snippets are supported, however autocomplete and hover info are being explored.

### Syntax Highlighting

Highlighting of key events as defined in *doom_events.script* and definitions in *doom_defs.script* makes the code easier to read and navigate. Keywords missing? Let me know with an [issue](https://github.com/thefyrewire/quadscript/issues)!

### Code Snippets

Some basic snippets are available. You can also type **namespace** when creating a new file to bring up the basic tutorial code for initilising a map. You can reference this [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701335671). Some more advanced snippets are coming soon.
